# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

The data set includes credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. Out of a total of 2,84,807 transactions, 492 were fraudulent. This data set is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of the total transactions. The data set has also been modified with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to maintain confidentiality, hence there is a lack of interpretability in the features.
